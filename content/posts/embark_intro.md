EMBA is a command line tool only, which is primarly designed for penetration testers. In contradiction to this, [EMBArk](https://github.com/e-m-b-a/embark) is the enterprise ready front-end wich uses EMBA as scanning back end.
EMBArk is a Django based web front end which allows the management of the firmware scanning environment on one central system. Via EMBArk it is possible for multiple users (e.g. a pentesting or dev team) to access the scanner and initiate scan tasks via the web browser.
To get a first impression of EMBArk check this short intro video from [Benedikt](https://github.com/BenediktMKuehne).
