EMBA is a command line tool only, which is primarly designed for penetration testers. In contradiction to this, EMBArk is the enterprise ready front-end wich uses EMBA as scanning back end.
EMBArk is a web based front end which allows the installation and the management of the firmware scanning environment on one central system. Via EMBArk it is possible for multiple users to access the scanner and initiate scan tasks via the web browser.
